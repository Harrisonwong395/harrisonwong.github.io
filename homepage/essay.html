          <h1 id="beg">Golden Unicorn-Connections are Everywhere</h1>

          <p id="ez">Lower East Side Chinatown is where it’s at. Food, parks, barbers,
            random graffiti everywhere, and waiters smoking in front of restaurants
            on their breaks, we have it all. The main reason I go to Chinatown is
            for the food. Although my family and I have never lived in Chinatown,
            both of my parents grew up in immigrant families in Chinatown. My earliest
            and fondest memories of Chinatown are of my paternal great grandparents’ and
            my grandparents’ “go to” restaurant, The Golden Unicorn. The restaurant serves
            traditional Cantonese food and my great-grandparents and grandparents have built
            relationships with the staff over the decades. They go there so often that most of
            the wait staff knows them by name. Every time they eat there, they get the “VIP”
            stamp on their bill indicating their status there.

            People all around New York come to Golden Unicorn for dim sum and a wide range of food choices.
             Whether you’re a Wong, a tourist, or a native New Yorker,
            you will come across this restaurant at some point in your life walking around in Chinatown.
            Golden Unicorn is a popular foodie destination. After dinners, from the outside,
            this restaurant may appear very disgusting considering all the trash around the buildings.
            Rats scurrying across the concrete grounds scavenging for food. The smell of garbage oozing
            out of torn shiny black trash bags mixed with the stale lingering cigarette smoke from the waiters.
            However, as a young child, looking up from my dad’s shoulders, standing in front of the restaurant,
            I saw what seemed to be a food heaven. Standing before me was a maroon painted wall with a bright yellow
            “Golden Unicorn Restaurant” sign inviting people to come inside to taste the delicious food.
            Oh, how my siblings and I were so excited to eat. Walking into the restaurant, seeing the bright red and gold colored walls,
            with red table cloths and gold colored upholstered chairs, it’s a sight to be seen.
            In Chinese culture, red and gold are considered “lucky colors”.
            Gold is the color of royalty and wealth. Red symbolizes fortune and prosperity.
            The restaurant serves some of my favorite Chinese dishes such as, beef with broccoli,
            and my all-time favorite, Peking pork chop! During dim sum, there is a wide variety of fluffy
            baos (buns with meat, some with sweet cream, and some that are plain).
            Walking into the dining room, the air is filled with laughter and conversation at every table.
             The well-worn red carpeting dulls the footsteps of the customers rushing to their tables.
            Listening to Chinese music that can never be understood. Never ending hugs of embracing extended family members.

            For my immediate and extended family, periodic meals at Golden Unicorn were a family tradition. It was a time for us to get together to enjoy a meal together.
            We hosted special occasion meals with extended family members as well as small simple meals to catch up with old friends.
            This restaurant holds a special place in my heart. My brother, some cousins, and I had a routine, at every family event we would play hide and seek tag.
            It was a children's game where the hiders have to run from the seeker, also known as the tagger. If you get chased down and tagged you’re it, and so forth.
            This was a never ending game until food got spilled or parents yelled at their kid for bumping into a customer or waiter. With this game someone was bound to get hurt,
            but, what was most important was that it taught us to be sympathetic and to look after one another. Always be cautious about the people around you. Just like in New York you should
            “always be aware of your surroundings” as my mother says. In the restaurant be warned of waiters moving constantly throughout the restaurant and in New York be aware of crackheads
            to not bump into them.


            What does it really mean to be connected? Connection is something that is built over time, sometimes over multiple generations.
            The connections that my great grandparents built at Golden Unicorn were handed down to my grandparents, then to the next generation,
            hopefully to be continued. Building connections is important. In building connections, you build a bridge of trust in a relationship.
            Connection is deeper than friendships. It’s the bonds and memories you create with each other over laughter,
            fun and food. For instance, growing up with my 3 siblings is the closest of relationships.
            As the famous saying goes, “Blood is thicker than water”—I never felt like this saying applied to me as I was growing up.
            But now, looking back at the memories I’ve created with my cousins and siblings, I realize that they are my best friends.
             Growing up together, we’ve developed a much stronger bond compared to a friendship that only developed a couple months ago.
